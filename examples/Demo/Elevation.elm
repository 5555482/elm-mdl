> The Material Design Lite (MDL) shadow is not a component in the same sense as
> an MDL card, menu, or textbox; it is a visual effect that can be assigned to a
> user interface element. The effect simulates a three-dimensional positioning of
> the element, as though it is slightly raised above the surface it rests upon â€”
> a positive z-axis value, in user interface terms. The shadow starts at the
> edges of the element and gradually fades outward, providing a realistic 3-D
> effect.
> 
> Shadows are a convenient and intuitive means of distinguishing an element from
> its surroundings. A shadow can draw the user's eye to an object and emphasize
> the object's importance, uniqueness, or immediacy.
> 
> Shadows are a well-established feature in user interfaces, and provide users
> with a visual clue to an object's intended use or value. Their design and use
> is an important factor in the overall user experience.)

The [Material Design Specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/elevation-shadows.html#elevation-shadows-elevation-android-)
pre-defines appropriate elevation for most UI elements; you need to manually
assign shadows only to your own elements. 

You are encouraged to visit the
[Material Design specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/elevation-shadows.html)
for details about appropriate use of shadows.
